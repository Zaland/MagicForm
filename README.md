# Multipage-Form ([Demo](http://web.cs.dal.ca/~zaland/Multipage-Form/index.html))
This example is a multipage form where user navigates through multiple steps before finishing the form. It looks cooler and allows for larger forms to be condensed down to simpler steps. It uses the following:

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for client side interactions. 
* [Sandstone Bootstrap](https://bootswatch.com/sandstone/) is used for the front-end design. 
* [jQuery Validate](http://jqueryvalidation.org/) is used for validation of the form.
